A NodeJS (14+) client for [singyeong](https://github.com/queer/singyeong) written in TypeScript.

## Installation
**Note**: singyeongjs only has [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) exports. It's possible to use it in a CommonJS
environment using a [dynamic `import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#dynamic_imports),
but we strongly recommend migrating to ESM if you want to use this library.

The package hasn't been published on npm yet.
